"""
Fly-to-coordinate guidance for the SeaYou drone.

Turns "go to this latitude/longitude and hold this height" into the same
roll/pitch/throttle bytes a human pilot's sticks produce. Nothing else in
the stack changes: the Pico still runs the fast attitude and rate loops,
and this only replaces the sticks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
READ THIS BEFORE ARMING A MISSION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This has NEVER been flown. It has been developed and tested only against
sim_drone.py. Two things about the real aircraft make it genuinely
dangerous until proven on a tether:

  * The real GPS module reports 0 satellites and has never produced a fix.
    Without a fix this module refuses to run at all, which is the correct
    behaviour but also means it has never seen real position data.
  * The barometer resolves to about 0.98 m, so height hold will bob by
    roughly a metre no matter how good the control law is. It is adequate
    for "climb to roughly 5 m and loiter"; it is not precision altitude.

The project's own flight notes warn against automating throttle until the
attitude loop is confirmed stable, and the aircraft crashed on 2026-09-12.
Fly this tethered, low, and with a finger on disarm.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why guidance runs here and not on the Pico
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Position control is SLOW - GPS updates around 10 Hz and a drone takes
seconds to cross open ground - so a few tens of milliseconds of network
latency is irrelevant to it. The fast loops that genuinely cannot tolerate
latency (attitude, rate) stay on the Pico where they always were. This is
the standard split, and it keeps flight-critical firmware untouched.

The consequence to understand: if the ground station link drops mid
mission, the Pi's own failsafe sends throttle 0 after 0.5 s. The drone does
NOT continue the mission on its own. Moving guidance onto the Pi would
change that, and is the next step for true autonomy.

THROTTLE_SPAN = 25.0

#: Proportional gain of the height hold, throttle units per metre. Was an
#: unnamed 6.0 in two places; named because the integral gain below is
#: chosen relative to it.
ALT_P_GAIN = 6.0

# --- the integral trim -------------------------------------------------
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. The height hold used to be pure proportional, and a P
# controller only produces a correction while an error exists. At a steady
# hover the commanded throttle must equal the aircraft's TRUE hover
# throttle, so the error settles at
#
#     err = (true_hover - HOVER_THROTTLE) / ALT_P_GAIN
#
# and stays there. Measured on the bench with the simulator hovering at 60
# against the assumed 45: a 5 m takeoff parked at exactly 2.50 m, throttle
# pinned at 60, never reached the arrive band, and timed out. (60-45)/6 =
# 2.5. It corrected, but to the wrong height.
#
# The integral accumulates that persistent error and walks the bias to
# where it should have been, which demotes HOVER_THROTTLE from a constant
# that must be right to a starting guess. Measure it anyway: the trim can
# only correct a hover the aircraft can actually reach, so a guess too low
# to leave the ground is still a guess too low to leave the ground.

#: Integral gain, throttle units per metre-second.
#:
#: Against the simulator's vertical response this puts the damping ratio
#: near 0.73 - comfortably damped, no overshoot worth the name - while
#: converging in tens of seconds rather than minutes. It was half this to
#: begin with, which was stable but so slow the takeoff timed out before
#: the trim had finished learning.
#:
#: The real aircraft's vertical gain is NOT known, so treat this as a
#: starting point and watch the first tethered hover for hunting.
ALT_I_GAIN = 1.0

#: Do not integrate outside this much error - a sanity guard against
#: learning from a nonsense setpoint, not a transient filter. Ramps are
#: already excluded by the `trim` flag, which only allows learning while
#: the setpoint is stationary.
#:
#: It MUST stay comfortably above the largest error the trim exists to
#: remove, which is ALT_I_LIMIT / ALT_P_GAIN = 3.3 m. It was 2.0, below
#: that, and the result was a trim that refused to learn precisely the
#: biases it was built for: a 15-unit hover error settles at 2.5 m, the
#: band rejected it, and the trim sat at 0.0 while the aircraft parked
#: 2.5 m low and timed out.
ALT_I_BAND_M = 5.0

#: Clamp on the learned trim, throttle units. Covers a true hover anywhere
#: in roughly 25-65 against an assumed 45.
ALT_I_LIMIT = 20.0

#: Only learn while genuinely airborne, metres. On the ground - or held on
#: a taut tether - the error is real, persistent, and NOT a hover bias, so
#: integrating it winds the throttle up and hands the aircraft a surprise
#: the moment it comes free. This is the condition that makes the trim
#: safe to leave running.
ALT_I_MIN_HEIGHT_M = 0.9

#: Hard ceiling on any throttle the guidance may command, percent. The
#: trim can add ALT_I_LIMIT on top of the proportional term, and an
#: integrator with no ceiling is an aircraft accelerating into the sky.
#: Anything needing more than this to hover is too heavy to be flying a
#: mission.

# --- takeoff and landing ----------------------------------------------
#
# THE BAROMETER IS THE LIMIT HERE, and it is worth knowing the number
# before trusting any of this. The firmware sends pressure as
# (uint16)(pascals / 10), so the smallest change that can be transmitted
# is 10 Pa - which is 0.83 m of height. Not the sensor's fault: a BMP388
# resolves far better than that, and the resolution is lost in the packet.
#
# So height is known to about a metre, and every constant below is sized
# for that. Anything tighter would be measuring noise.

#: Climb rate the takeoff aims for, m/s. Deliberately slow: the height
#: it is climbing against only updates every 0.83 m, so a fast climb
#: would overshoot by most of a step before the controller noticed.
CLIMB_RATE_MS = 0.5

#: Descent rate the landing aims for, m/s. Slower than the climb, because
#: the ground does not move out of the way.
DESCENT_RATE_MS = 0.4

#: Counted as "at the commanded height". One barometer step is 0.83 m, so
#: this is already as tight as the hardware allows.
ALT_ARRIVE_M = 1.0

#: Below this the landing stops trying to measure height and just ramps
#: the throttle down. Within one step of the ground the barometer cannot
#: tell 0.8 m from touchdown, so continuing to trust it is how you cut
#: the motors while still in the air.
LAND_CUTOFF_M = 0.9

#: How long the final throttle ramp takes, seconds. A ramp rather than a
#: cut: from one barometer step up, a cut IS a drop.
LAND_RAMP_S = 3.0

#: Time a takeoff gets ON TOP OF the climb itself, seconds.
#:
#: The allowance is (target height / CLIMB_RATE_MS) + this, so a 10 m
#: climb is not held to the same clock as a 2 m one. It was a flat 30 s,
#: which is less than the 20 s ramp plus settling that a 10 m takeoff
#: needs - the same mistake as a flat mission timeout against a
#: variable-distance waypoint, and it bit for the same reason: the
#: manoeuvre's duration depends on how far it has to go.
TAKEOFF_MARGIN_S = 30.0
