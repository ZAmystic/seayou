"""
Simulated SeaYou drone - connects to the ground station like the real one.

Exists so the ground station, the dashboard, and the GPS/waypoint work can
all be built and tested without the aircraft: no props spinning, nothing
overheating, nothing to crash, and it works when the drone is packed away.

It speaks the exact same protocol as drone_agent.py and emits telemetry in
the exact shape unpack_telemetry() produces in server.py, so the dashboard
cannot tell the difference. If something works against this and then fails
against the real drone, the difference is real and worth chasing.

It also simulates a WORKING GPS, which the real aircraft currently does not
have (the module reports 0 satellites). That is deliberate: it means the
fly-to-coordinates feature can be written and proven now, and only needs a
working GPS module fitted to go live.

    python sim_drone.py --ground-station ws://127.0.0.1:8090/drone --token X

The physics are crude on purpose - enough to exercise the UI, the mission
logic and the failsafes, nowhere near enough to tune a PID against. Do not
use this to validate flight behaviour.
